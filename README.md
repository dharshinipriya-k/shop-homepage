React Shopping Cart Project.

In this project functionalities like add to cart and remove from cart are implemented. When add to cart is clicked by the user, the button will change to remove from cart and the number of items in cart will incremented and vice versa. These functionalities are achieved using react components, by using hooks and conditional rendering.
